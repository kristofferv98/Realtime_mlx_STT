# VoiceActivityDetection Feature Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the VoiceActivityDetection feature module. All tests have been verified and are passing, indicating that the VoiceActivityDetection module is complete and ready for use in the vertical slice architecture.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following components:

### 1. WebRtcVadDetector
- [`webrtc_vad_test.py`](./webrtc_vad_test.py)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage**:
  - Initialization and configuration
  - Silence and speech detection
  - Detection confidence levels
  - Parameter adjustment and tuning
  - Processing audio chunks of different sizes
  - Real audio sample testing
  - Reset and state management
  - Configuration retrieval

### 2. SileroVadDetector
- [`silero_vad_test.py`](./silero_vad_test.py)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage**:
  - Model loading and initialization
  - Threshold configuration
  - Silence and speech detection
  - Confidence scoring
  - Window size adjustment
  - Processing full audio files and chunks
  - Model cleanup and resource management
  - Graceful handling of conversion failures

### 3. CombinedVadDetector
- [`combined_vad_test.py`](./combined_vad_test.py)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage**:
  - Two-stage detection pipeline (WebRTC + Silero)
  - State transitions (SILENCE, POTENTIAL_SPEECH, SPEECH, POTENTIAL_SILENCE)
  - Frame counting and confirmation thresholds
  - Statistics tracking and reporting
  - Different detection modes (WebRTC-only vs. combined)
  - Performance with real audio samples
  - Reset and cleanup operations

## Running the Tests

All tests can be run using the [`run_all_tests.py`](./run_all_tests.py) script:

```bash
python tests/Features/VoiceActivityDetection/run_all_tests.py
```

The script will discover and run all test cases in the directory.

## Test Design

The tests are designed to be:

1. **Robust to Environment Changes**: Tests handle cases where dependencies might not be available through graceful skipping.

2. **Self-contained**: Each test can run independently and doesn't rely on other tests.

3. **Comprehensive**: All key functionality is tested, including edge cases and error handling.

4. **Realistic**: Tests use both synthetic audio (silence and tones) and real audio samples.

5. **Fast**: Tests are optimized to run quickly while still thoroughly testing functionality.

## Dependency Management

- **WebRTC VAD**: Requires the `webrtcvad` Python package.
- **Silero VAD**: Requires PyTorch (`torch`) and ideally `torchaudio`.
- **Combined VAD**: Requires both `webrtcvad` and `torch`.

Tests gracefully skip when dependencies are not available, with clear error messages.

## Performance Considerations

- **Model Loading**: The Silero model is loaded once per test run to minimize overhead.
- **ONNX Conversion**: The tests attempt to use ONNX for faster inference, but fall back to PyTorch if conversion fails.
- **Frame Processing**: Tests use small frame counts to keep execution fast.

## Completion Status

The VoiceActivityDetection feature module is **COMPLETE** and ready for integration with other features in the vertical slice architecture. All detectors have been implemented and thoroughly tested, providing options ranging from lightweight (WebRTC) to high-accuracy (Silero) to combined approaches.
