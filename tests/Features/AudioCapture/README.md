# AudioCapture Feature Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the AudioCapture feature module. All tests have been verified and are passing, indicating that the AudioCapture module is complete and ready for use in the vertical slice architecture.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following components:

### 1. AudioCommandHandler
- [`audio_command_handler_test.py`](./audio_command_handler_test.py)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage**:
  - Command handling for all audio commands (list devices, select device, start/stop recording)
  - Provider selection and management
  - Error handling for invalid commands and parameters
  - Device selection across providers
  - Recording control with options (save recording, flush buffer)

### 2. AudioCaptureModule
- [`audio_capture_module_test.py`](./audio_capture_module_test.py)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing (1 skipped)
- **Coverage**:
  - Module registration and setup
  - Device listing and selection

### 4. FileAudioProvider
- [`file_audio_provider_test.py`](./file_audio_provider_test.py)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage**:
  - Provider initialization and setup
  - File loading and validation
  - Audio playback (start/stop)
  - Playback position control
  - Looping functionality
  - Audio chunk reading
  - Duration calculation
  - Error handling for invalid files
  - Event publishing
  - File-system independent testing with mocking

### 5. Event Publishing and Handling
- Covered in all test files
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage**:
  - AudioChunkCapturedEvent publishing and handling
  - RecordingStateChangedEvent publishing and handling
  - Event inheritance and parameter passing
  - Event bus integration

## Running the Tests

All tests can be run using the [`run_all_tests.py`](./run_all_tests.py) script:

```bash
python tests/Features/AudioCapture/run_all_tests.py
```

The script will discover and run all test cases in the directory.

## Test Design

The tests are designed to be:

1. **Hardware-independent**: All hardware interactions (microphones, audio devices) are mocked to ensure tests can run in any environment, including CI/CD pipelines.

2. **File-system independent**: File operations are mocked to avoid dependencies on actual files.

3. **Thread-safe**: Thread management is carefully controlled to avoid race conditions and ensure deterministic test results.

4. **Comprehensive**: All public methods and edge cases are tested.

5. **Isolated**: Each test starts with a clean environment to avoid cross-test contamination.

## Mocking Strategy

- **PyAudio**: The entire PyAudio library is mocked to avoid hardware dependencies.
- **Soundfile**: File operations are mocked to avoid actual file dependencies.
- **Threading**: Direct thread manipulation is avoided in favor of controlled execution.
- **Event Bus**: Real event bus is used but with controlled event publishing.

## Completion Status

The AudioCapture feature module is **COMPLETE** and ready for integration with other features in the vertical slice architecture. All core functionality has been implemented and thoroughly tested.
